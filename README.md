# Convolution Neural Network Project

This project is written in VHDL and python

with python your input image will be converted to gray color image and its pixels will be saved in a file
with vhdl part your image will be filtered by some random filter and the results will be saved in a file
with python those pixels will be saved with an actual image file and you can use it
